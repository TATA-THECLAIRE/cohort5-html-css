# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I showcase my tech journey, projects, and growth as a developer.

The website includes a navigation menu that allows visitors to explore different sections. By clicking on **Craftsmanship**, you can view my non-technical skills and creative work, highlighting abilities beyond software development.

> **Note:** I generated the LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email SVG icons using AI, as I could not find exact images that matched the style I wanted.

## Purpose
- Document my learning and growth in tech
- Share my projects and experience
- Highlight both technical and non-technical skills

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS


## Status
This website is actively maintained and will continue to evolve as my journey progresses and its hosted on github pages.
