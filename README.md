# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I showcase my tech journey, projects, and growth as a developer.

The website includes a navigation menu that allows visitors to explore different sections. By clicking on **Craftsmanship**, you can view my non-technical skills and creative work, highlighting abilities beyond software development.

**javasceript section:** I removes all the projects that i showcase in the project section and replaced all of the with javascript projects ffrom the course, when you hover over the image of the project you will see two buttons , live demo were you can explore the projects since they are deployed and githup were the source code is found

> **Note:** I generated the LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email SVG icons using AI, as I could not find exact images that matched the style I wanted.
